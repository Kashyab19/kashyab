The only time Spotify did a good job at recommending was when it showed me the [Founders Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7txiovdzPARhjm18NwMUYj) by David Senra. My first episode was about how Jensen Huang works and then it was Elon Musk, Steve Jobs and Todd Graves.

Since then my gym sessions have been filled with Founders' episodes on repeat trying to meticulously pause, absorb and move on to the next.

A few of the most successful traits among the founders are:
1. They have **huge conviction** about what they do
2. They **obsess over the details** and staying on top of it
3. They have **immense self-confidence**
4. They acknowledge the **failures fast**, learn from them and move really quick


It's no wonder I will add more notes from the Founders' Podcast - huge credit to David's storytelling style (amazed because his in-audio ads are seamlessly transitioning in and out)
